## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to my **Arduino Projects Collection** — a portfolio of embedded systems projects built using the **Arduino platform**, **Embedded C/C++**, and a range of electronic components and sensors.

Each project targets a specific concept in embedded development: from basic button-controlled GPIO, to PWM-based dimming, analog sensor reading, and multi-component game logic. These are honest learning projects that reflect my progression as a **Computer Science student specializing in Embedded Systems** — built, tested, and documented on real hardware.

Every project folder is self-contained and includes the full Arduino source code (`.ino`), a circuit image, a recorded demo video, and an animated GIF — making it easy to review each project without setting up the hardware.

### 💡 01 - Controlled LED

> **Category:** Digital Input & Output | GPIO Control

A foundational project demonstrating LED control through a **push button input**. When the button is pressed, the Arduino reads the digital input signal and toggles the LED on or off accordingly — reinforcing the core input/output relationship at the heart of embedded systems programming.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**
- `pinMode()`, `digitalRead()`, and `digitalWrite()` functions
- Digital input reading and output switching
- Button state detection in the main loop
- Setup/loop firmware architecture

**Circuit Preview:**

### 🪩 02 - Disco Strobe Light

> **Category:** LED Sequencing | Timing Control

An energetic multi-LED strobe sequencer that rapidly cycles through light patterns, simulating a disco strobe effect. This project demonstrates array-based LED management, precise microsecond-level timing, and the use of loops to produce dynamic lighting sequences.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**
- LED array management
- High-frequency strobe timing (`delayMicroseconds`)
- Pattern sequencing with `for` loops
- Non-blocking delay techniques

### 🔆 03 - Light Dimmer

> **Category:** PWM | Analog Output

A hardware-level light dimmer that uses **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** to achieve smooth, continuous control of LED brightness. Brightness levels are controlled via a potentiometer, with the analog input mapped to PWM output values in real time — demonstrating core embedded signal processing.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**
- PWM signal generation with `analogWrite()`
- Analog input reading with `analogRead()`
- Input-to-output value mapping (`map()` function)
- Real-time signal adjustment

### 🧠 04 - Memory Game

> **Category:** Game Logic | Interactive Systems

A fully interactive **Simon Says**-style memory game implemented entirely in embedded C on Arduino. The system generates and displays a growing LED sequence that the player must reproduce using push buttons. Includes difficulty escalation, win/loss detection, and audio feedback via a buzzer.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**
- State machine design
- Random sequence generation
- Button debouncing
- Multi-LED and buzzer coordination
- Game loop logic and user interaction

### 🌱 05 - Plant Monitor

> **Category:** Sensor Integration | Embedded Automation

An automated plant health monitoring system that reads **soil moisture levels** using an analog capacitive sensor and triggers an alert (LED indicator + buzzer) when soil moisture drops below a defined threshold. Data is also streamed to the Serial Monitor for real-time observation.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**
- Analog sensor integration
- Threshold-based decision logic
- Serial communication for data logging
- Embedded automation using polling-based sensor reads

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through building and documenting these projects, the following practical skills were developed and reinforced:

- **Embedded Programming Fundamentals** — Writing clean firmware in C/C++ for microcontrollers with limited RAM and flash, following the setup/loop structure of the Arduino runtime.
- **PWM & Analog Signal Control** — Using `analogWrite()` and `analogRead()` to bridge the gap between digital microcontrollers and analog real-world signals.
- **Sensor-Driven Automation** — Reading raw analog sensor values and acting on them through threshold comparisons to drive output peripherals.
- **State Machine Design** — Structuring interactive systems like the Memory Game into clearly defined states with predictable transitions and clean logic flow.
- **Hardware Debugging** — Diagnosing issues where software behavior and physical circuit conditions interact — a core embedded systems skill.
